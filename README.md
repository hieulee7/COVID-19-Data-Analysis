## Project Workflow

1. **Data Understanding and Preparation**:
   - Cleaning the data to handle missing values and inconsistencies.
   - Splitting the dataset into training (70%) and test (30%) sets.
   - Exploring relationships between features using correlation matrices and scatter plots.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Analyzing trends in infection rates over time.
   - Visualizing relationships between features to uncover hidden patterns.

3. **Feature Engineering**:
   - Selecting features based on correlation and relevance to the target variable.
   - Transforming features for better model performance.

4. **Model Development**:
   - Building and evaluating machine learning models using the Scikit-learn library.
   - Assessing model performance using metrics like RMSE and MAE.

5. **Visualization**:
   - Creating visualizations to present trends, predictions, and key findings effectively.
